Reefuino is an Arduino Reef Aquarium controller.

ATTENTION: This set of libraries is still being tested and developed. 
There isn't yet documentation covering the hardware schematics. This will be provided soon.

The aim is to build an aquarium controller with components that can be purchased off eBay, without requiring any special assembling or soldering.
